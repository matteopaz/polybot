# General Instructions

This is a polymarket tool. API key is available as POLYMARKET_API_KEY defined in .env.

# Resources

Please crawl resources frequently. API syntax is the most common failure mode -- double check all your implementations and calls.

Polymarket API reference: https://docs.polymarket.com/ 


# Coding Style and Context

Please adopt a research-like coding style. Your code need not handle every edge case, nor provide type and error checking for every object.
Code pragmatically, adopting the simplest and easiest-to-read approach to every problem. Less code is always better.
Be unafraid of adding comments to code, long-form or linewise.

Remember- this project is not a production tool- just a hack for personal use. Make it easy to debug and maintain.
